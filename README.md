# CodeSample


These code samples belong to the project I am working on for a startup company.
All the code pushed was reviewed and pushed with the consent of my manager.

The whole project contains 

1) Models - These define the data types and names for the Schema in the MongoDB.
2) Routes - To do routing when a partiulcar request hits the Server.
3) Controllers - Where the services are written to process the business logic.
4) package.json - Where all the node dependencies are present.
5) app.js - Entry part for the application.
